# About This Project
A simple understanding of this project:
<br />
I was looking for a way to extract listings from [Facebook Marketplace's listings for rental real estate in Vancouver](https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/vancouver/1-bedroom-apartments). This project uses Typescript and Puppeteer
<br />


# Project Status
Todo: <br />
  Add Docker and Start the scrapper as Headless


# How to Set Up this utility
```bash
$ npm install # This installs all project's dependencies
$ npm start   # This starts the scrapper
```
Using npm start is going to start scrapping the webpage, a chromium window should pop up, in newer versions the process will be totally headless


# Technologies Used
- [Puppetteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)
